# ROADMAP

## Todo

- [ ] TRANSFORM THIS INTO AN APP FOR DRILLING CHORDS AND SCALES


- [ ] add a scene.cpp file and put the piano scene in there
- [ ] add a scene for configuration, including: 
    - [ ] add dropdown box for midi device selection
- [ ] add all scales and all chord practices for you to use it
- [ ] hide the input box somehow and print the chord list
- [ ] add sqlite integration
- [ ] add a dummy midi device that uses the normal keyboard instead

- [ ] think about how to incorporate this knowledge of scales here into the project:
